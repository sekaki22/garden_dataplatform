# Garden sensor platform project

The goal of this project is to improve the yield in my vegetable garden by reading data from multiple sensors which will be read using an esp32 microcontroller and sent over http to a Raspberry Pi. The data is stored in a Sqlite database (on the pi) so that historic data can be analysed using SQL commands. For now I am reading data from the following sensors:

- DHT22 (temperature and humidity)
- TSL 2591 (Light intensity using lux & infrared measurements)

**To do: add more information about architecture and how to use the code**

## Physical components and infrastructure


## Code explananation
